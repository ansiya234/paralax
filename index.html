        <h3>SHAWARMA</h3><br>
        <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish of spiced meat that's traditionally cooked on a vertical spit, but can also be made at home using a variety of methods. Here are some tips for making shawarma:  MarinateYou can marinate the chicken in a ziplock bag to keep it well coated. You can also use a container, but you'll need to turn the chicken more often or increase the amount of marinade. Cook You can cook shawarma on the stove, grill, or in the oven. If you're using the broiler, place the chicken on a cooling rack on top of a baking tray to keep it juicy.Serve Shawarma is commonly served in a pita or lavash wrap with vegetables and dressing. Some common accompaniments include tahini sauce, hummus, amba sauce, or yogurt sauce. Rest Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving so the juices redistribute and don't run out when you slice it. </p><br><br>

        <h3>ALFAHM</h3><br>
        <p>Clean and wash Whole Chickens (2.2 lb). Cut it into two pieces lengthwise, or into four pieces. Using a fork
        or knife prick the chicken well so that the marination goes inside the chicken. <br> Grind Onion (1), Fresh
        Ginger (1/2 in), Garlic (3 cloves), Green Chili Peppers (2), Tomato (1), Yogurt (1 Tbsp), the juice from
        Lemon (1), Ground Black Pepper (as needed), Arabic Masala (2 tsp), and Salt (to taste) into a fine paste.
        <br> Marinate the chicken with this paste and cover and keep in the fridge for 3-4 hours. It's good if you
        can leave it overnight.
        <br> Here it is grilled in an oven. For that preheat the oven at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the
        chicken on the grill tray. You should place another tray below so that all the drippings get collected in
        it.<br> Grill for about 45 to 50 minutes turning sides in between and brush some olive oil each time. <br>
        Or grill it on a charcoal grill turning sides in between and brush some Olive Oil (1 Tbsp) each time.<br>
        Serve hot with kuboos, chapathi or roti with some salad lemon wedges and any dip of your choice.

        <h3>FRENCH FRIES</h3><br>
        <p>Soak in water: To remove excess starch and help achieve crispy fries, soak sliced potatoes in water for 15–30 minutes. You can also add sugar to the water. 
            Use a serrated knife: A serrated knife creates a rougher surface that leads to crispier fries. 
            Use russet potatoes: Russet potatoes are starchy and have less moisture, making them ideal for french fries. 
            Double-fry: For extra crunch, you can fry the potatoes twice, allowing them to cool between batches. 
            Simmer: Simmering the potatoes for 10 minutes can help make them extra crispy. 
            Use enough oil: Make sure there's enough oil in the pot to allow for bubbling. 
            Season: Season to taste, as the fries already have some salt. 
            Use a deep fryer: Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375°F (190°C). 
            Drain on paper towels: After frying, drain the fries on paper towels.

        <h3>PIZZA</h3><br>
        <p>
            Preparing the toppings: Different types of pizza use different sauces and toppings. 
Baking: You can bake pizza in a variety of ways, including in an oven, toaster oven, grill, or special oven. The baking temperature is usually 450°F or higher. 

If you want to make a thin crust pizza, you can sprinkle cornmeal on the baking tray before adding the dough. 
You can use a wooden peel to transfer the dough to the oven. 
If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use an upside down baking sheet. 
Frozen pizzas are also available, which allows you to skip the dough and topping preparation steps.
